- 👋 Hi, I’m Vinsens S
- 👀 I’m interested in backend development, mainly the ones using Golang. AI is pretty cool too, I'd like to do some at one day
- 🌱 I’m currently (still) learning Golang. It's been an amazing learning experience with this programming language!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects with Golang, or maybe Python, and maybe a little bit of Java
- 📫 How to reach me:
  - Send me email to vinsens.setyoraharjo@gmail.com!
