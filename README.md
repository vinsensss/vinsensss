- 👀 I’m interested in backend development, mainly the ones using Golang. AI seems cool too, I'd like to do some AI thingamajig one day...
- 🌱 I’m currently (still) learning Golang. It's been an amazing learning experience with this programming language!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects with Golang, or maybe Python, and maybe a little bit of Java
